## What are KPI in Incident Management?

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Incident Management are metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of the incident management process. These KPIs help in monitoring performance, identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring that service level agreements (SLAs) are met. Here are some common KPIs in Incident Management:

### 1. **Number of Incidents**
   - **Description:** Total number of incidents reported in a specific period.
   - **Purpose:** Helps to understand the volume of incidents and identify trends over time.

### 2. **Incident Resolution Time**
   - **Description:** The average time taken to resolve an incident from the time it was reported.
   - **Purpose:** Measures the efficiency of the incident resolution process and helps in identifying delays.

### 3. **First Call Resolution Rate (FCR)**
   - **Description:** Percentage of incidents resolved during the first contact with the service desk.
   - **Purpose:** Indicates the effectiveness of the initial support and the knowledge level of the service desk team.

### 4. **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)**
   - **Description:** Average time taken to fully resolve an incident.
   - **Purpose:** Measures the overall efficiency of the incident management process.

### 5. **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)**
   - **Description:** Average time taken to repair and restore service after an incident has been identified.
   - **Purpose:** Focuses on the repair aspect of incident resolution, highlighting the technical team's effectiveness.

### 6. **Incident Response Time**
   - **Description:** The average time taken to respond to an incident after it has been reported.
   - **Purpose:** Measures the responsiveness of the incident management team.

### 7. **Incident Reopen Rate**
   - **Description:** Percentage of incidents that are reopened after being marked as resolved.
   - **Purpose:** Indicates the quality of incident resolution and the effectiveness of the solutions provided.

### 8. **Percentage of Incidents Meeting SLA**
   - **Description:** Percentage of incidents resolved within the agreed SLA time frames.
   - **Purpose:** Measures compliance with SLAs and helps in identifying areas where SLA breaches occur.

### 9. **Backlog of Incidents**
   - **Description:** Number of incidents that remain unresolved over a specific period.
   - **Purpose:** Indicates potential bottlenecks and resource constraints in the incident management process.

### 10. **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)**
   - **Description:** The satisfaction level of users with the incident resolution process, often measured through surveys.
   - **Purpose:** Provides insight into the end-user experience and the perceived quality of support.

### 11. **Cost Per Incident**
   - **Description:** The average cost incurred to resolve an incident.
   - **Purpose:** Helps in understanding the financial impact of incidents and identifying cost-saving opportunities.

### 12. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Rate**
   - **Description:** The percentage of incidents for which a root cause analysis is performed.
   - **Purpose:** Measures the thoroughness of the incident resolution process and the commitment to preventing recurrence.

### 13. **Incident Severity Distribution**
   - **Description:** The distribution of incidents by severity levels (e.g., critical, high, medium, low).
   - **Purpose:** Helps in understanding the impact of incidents and prioritizing resources accordingly.

### 14. **Recurring Incidents Rate**
   - **Description:** The percentage of incidents that recur within a specified period.
   - **Purpose:** Indicates the effectiveness of permanent fixes and preventive measures.

### 15. **Average Time Between Incidents**
   - **Description:** The average time interval between incidents.
   - **Purpose:** Measures the stability and reliability of the IT environment.

By monitoring these KPIs, organizations can gain valuable insights into their incident management processes, identify areas for improvement, ensure adherence to SLAs, and ultimately enhance the overall quality of their IT services.
