#### **Incident Priority Decision:**

- **Based on the criteria met, the incident is classified as:**  
   - [ ] **P1 (Priority 1 - Critical)**  
   - [ ] **P2 (Priority 2 - High)**  
- **Additional Comments:**  
  -

### **P1 vs P2 Qualification Guidelines:**

- **P1 (Priority 1):**
   - Affects critical business functions or systems.
   - Has a large or widespread impact on users or customers.
   - There is an immediate and significant financial, regulatory, or reputational risk.
   - Requires urgent escalation and resolution within a short time frame.

- **P2 (Priority 2):**
   - Affects important, but non-critical systems or services.
   - Impact is significant but not immediate or widespread.
   - Potential risks exist, but they are manageable and recovery is possible without severe consequences.
   - Resolution is urgent but can take slightly longer than P1.

This format will help streamline the decision-making process and ensure incidents are classified with proper urgency.
