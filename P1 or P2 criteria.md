P1 vs P2 Qualification Guidelines:

P1 (Priority 1):

Affects critical business functions or systems.

Has a large or widespread impact on users or customers.

There is an immediate and significant financial, regulatory, or reputational risk.

Requires urgent escalation and resolution within a short time frame.


P2 (Priority 2):

Affects important, but non-critical systems or services.

Impact is significant but not immediate or widespread.

Potential risks exist, but they are manageable and recovery is possible without severe consequences.

Resolution is urgent but can take slightly longer than P1.
