## What criteria do you use to categorize incidents?

Categorizing incidents correctly is crucial for effective Incident Management, as it helps prioritize and address issues appropriately. Here are the key criteria used to categorize incidents:

1. **Impact:**
   - **Extent of Disruption:** Assess the scope of the incident in terms of how many users or systems are affected.
   - **Business Impact:** Evaluate the effect on business operations, including financial impact, reputational damage, and operational downtime.

2. **Urgency:**
   - **Time Sensitivity:** Determine how quickly the incident needs to be resolved to prevent further impact.
   - **Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** Consider any SLAs that specify required response and resolution times.

3. **Type of Incident:**
   - **Hardware Issues:** Problems related to physical equipment like servers, workstations, or network devices.
   - **Software Issues:** Issues related to applications, operating systems, or middleware.
   - **Network Issues:** Problems affecting network connectivity, bandwidth, or configuration.
   - **Security Incidents:** Breaches, malware infections, or other security-related issues.
   - **Service Requests:** Requests for information, access, or other non-disruptive services.

4. **Priority:**
   - **Combination of Impact and Urgency:** Use a priority matrix that combines impact and urgency to assign a priority level (e.g., low, medium, high, critical).

5. **Affected Services:**
   - **Service Catalog:** Identify which services listed in the service catalog are impacted by the incident.
   - **Critical Services:** Give higher priority to incidents affecting critical or highly-used services.

6. **User Category:**
   - **End Users:** Incidents reported by general users.
   - **VIP Users:** Incidents reported by key stakeholders, executives, or high-priority clients.
   - **Technical Staff:** Incidents reported by IT personnel or other technical staff.

7. **Recurring Incidents:**
   - **Frequency:** Track how often similar incidents occur and categorize them accordingly.
   - **Known Errors:** Link to any known errors or problems identified in the Problem Management process.

8. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - **Immediate Cause:** Determine if the incident is due to a known issue or a new, unidentified problem.
   - **Related Incidents:** Group incidents that stem from the same root cause or affect similar services.

By using these criteria, an organization can ensure that incidents are categorized accurately and consistently, leading to more effective prioritization and resolution efforts.
