# What is Fishbone technique to get RCA?

The **Fishbone Diagram**, also known as the **Ishikawa Diagram** or **Cause-and-Effect Diagram**, is a tool used in Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to systematically identify and analyze the causes of a problem or issue. It helps teams visually map out the different potential causes of a problem, which can then be analyzed to determine the root cause.

### Overview of the Fishbone Diagram

The Fishbone Diagram is called so because of its shape. It resembles a fish skeleton with the problem or effect at the head and various causes extending out like bones. Here’s how the Fishbone Diagram works:

1. **Define the Problem**: Clearly state the problem or effect you are analyzing. This is written at the head of the "fish."

2. **Identify Major Categories of Causes**: The main "bones" of the fish represent major categories or types of causes. Common categories include:
   - **People**: Issues related to personnel, training, or human error.
   - **Processes**: Problems with procedures, workflows, or processes.
   - **Materials**: Issues with raw materials, components, or supplies.
   - **Machines/Technology**: Equipment failures, technology malfunctions, or inadequacies.
   - **Environment**: External factors such as environmental conditions or organizational factors.
   - **Measurement**: Problems with metrics, data collection, or measurement systems.

3. **Brainstorm Potential Causes**: For each major category, brainstorm and list all potential causes that could contribute to the problem. These are drawn as smaller bones or "ribs" off the main categories.

4. **Analyze and Investigate**: Review each potential cause listed and gather data or evidence to confirm if they are contributing to the problem. This step involves deeper analysis to identify the root cause(s).

5. **Identify Root Cause(s)**: Determine which of the potential causes are the actual root causes by analyzing the data collected. Root causes are the fundamental issues that, if resolved, would prevent the problem from recurring.

6. **Develop Action Plan**: Once the root cause(s) are identified, develop and implement corrective actions to address them and prevent recurrence.

### Steps to Create a Fishbone Diagram

1. **Draw the Diagram**:
   - Draw a horizontal arrow pointing to the right. This arrow represents the “spine” of the fish.
   - Write the problem or effect at the head of the arrow.

2. **Add Major Categories**:
   - Draw diagonal lines (the “bones”) extending from the spine. Label each line with one of the major categories of causes.

3. **Identify Causes**:
   - For each major category, draw smaller lines (the “ribs”) extending from the main category lines. List potential causes on these lines.

4. **Analyze**:
   - Discuss and evaluate each cause to determine its impact on the problem. Use data and evidence to support your analysis.

5. **Determine Root Cause(s)**:
   - Based on the analysis, identify the root cause(s) that need to be addressed.

### Example of a Fishbone Diagram

Imagine you are trying to resolve an issue with late deliveries in a company. Here’s how you might set up a Fishbone Diagram:

1. **Problem Statement**: Late Deliveries (at the head of the fish).

2. **Major Categories**:
   - **People**: Lack of training, insufficient staffing.
   - **Processes**: Inefficient order processing, lack of standardized procedures.
   - **Materials**: Supply chain delays, inventory issues.
   - **Machines/Technology**: Malfunctioning delivery tracking system, outdated software.
   - **Environment**: Poor communication with suppliers, external factors like weather.

3. **Identify Causes**:
   - **People**: 
     - Lack of training on new system.
     - High turnover rate.
   - **Processes**:
     - Manual order entry errors.
     - Delays in order approval.
   - **Materials**:
     - Suppliers' delivery delays.
     - Low inventory levels.
   - **Machines/Technology**:
     - Tracking system downtime.
     - Integration issues between systems.
   - **Environment**:
     - Communication breakdown with suppliers.
     - Adverse weather conditions.

4. **Analyze and Investigate**:
   - Review each cause to determine its contribution to the problem of late deliveries.

5. **Identify Root Cause(s)**:
   - For example, if you find that most of the delays are due to the tracking system downtime and supplier delays, these would be identified as root causes.

6. **Develop Action Plan**:
   - Implement improvements to the tracking system and establish better communication protocols with suppliers.

### Benefits of the Fishbone Diagram

- **Visual Representation**: Provides a clear and structured visual representation of potential causes.
- **Systematic Approach**: Helps in systematically organizing and analyzing possible causes.
- **Team Collaboration**: Encourages team collaboration and brainstorming to identify all potential causes.
- **Problem Solving**: Aids in identifying root causes and developing effective solutions.

By using the Fishbone Diagram, teams can effectively analyze complex problems and ensure that all potential causes are considered in the search for solutions.
