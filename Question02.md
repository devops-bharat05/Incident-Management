## Can you explain the primary objective of Incident Management in ITIL?

The primary objective of Incident Management in ITIL is to restore normal service operation as quickly as possible while minimizing the impact on business operations, thus ensuring the best possible levels of service quality and availability. Specifically, this involves:

1. **Rapid Restoration:** Quickly resolving incidents to return IT services to their normal functioning state.
2. **Minimizing Impact:** Reducing the negative impact on business operations and ensuring that any disruptions are as short-lived as possible.
3. **User Satisfaction:** Ensuring users and stakeholders are kept informed and satisfied with the resolution process.
4. **Consistent Handling:** Providing a structured approach for handling all incidents to ensure consistency, efficiency, and effectiveness.
5. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying and addressing the underlying causes of incidents to prevent recurrence where possible, though this often overlaps with Problem Management.

By achieving these objectives, Incident Management helps maintain the smooth operation of IT services, thereby supporting business continuity and productivity.
