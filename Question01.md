## How you will differentiate an Incident and a service request?

In ITIL, an incident and a service request are differentiated based on their nature and the way they are handled:

1. **Incident:**
   - **Definition:** An incident is an unplanned interruption to an IT service or a reduction in the quality of an IT service.
   - **Objective:** The primary goal of Incident Management is to restore normal service operation as quickly as possible to minimize the impact on business operations.
   - **Examples:** Server downtime, application errors, network issues, hardware failures, etc.
   - **Handling:** Incidents often require immediate attention and may involve troubleshooting, diagnosis, and quick resolution.

2. **Service Request:**
   - **Definition:** A service request is a formal request from a user for something to be provided, such as information, advice, a standard change, or access to an IT service.
   - **Objective:** Service Request Management aims to handle requests that do not involve an interruption or degradation of service but instead seek to fulfill a need or provide a service.
   - **Examples:** Password reset, software installation, access requests, request for new hardware, etc.
   - **Handling:** Service requests are typically handled through a predefined, often straightforward, process and do not usually require the urgency or complexity associated with incident resolution.

**Key Differences:**
- **Nature:** Incidents are disruptions or reductions in service quality, while service requests are formal requests for services or information.
- **Urgency:** Incidents generally require urgent attention to restore service, whereas service requests follow a more routine fulfillment process.
- **Goal:** The goal of Incident Management is to restore service quickly, while the goal of Service Request Management is to efficiently fulfill user requests.
- **Process:** Incident Management often involves diagnosis and troubleshooting, while Service Request Management follows predefined workflows and procedures.
