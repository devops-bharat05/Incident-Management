## Symphony Summit ticketing Flow

The **Symphony SummitAI** ticketing tool is an IT Service Management (ITSM) solution that provides an end-to-end approach to managing incidents, service requests, changes, and problems within an organization. It helps IT teams automate workflows, track tickets, enforce service-level agreements (SLAs), and provide transparency to end users and stakeholders.

Here’s a detailed flow of how Symphony Summit's ticketing process typically works:

---

### 1. **Ticket Creation**
There are multiple ways a ticket (incident or service request) can be created in Symphony Summit:

- **Self-Service Portal**: End users can log in to the portal and raise a ticket by providing details about their issue or request. The form usually includes fields for:
  - Ticket type (incident, service request, problem, etc.).
  - Description of the issue/request.
  - Urgency and impact.
  - Supporting attachments (e.g., screenshots, logs).
  
- **Email-to-Ticket**: End users can send an email to a specific email address (e.g., servicedesk@company.com), and Symphony Summit automatically converts the email into a ticket in the system.

- **Phone Calls**: Helpdesk agents can create tickets based on user-reported issues via phone calls.

- **Chatbot Integration**: Users can interact with chatbots or virtual agents integrated into Summit, which can log the ticket after collecting necessary details from the user.

- **Monitoring Tools**: Automated systems or monitoring tools can create tickets based on predefined triggers or alerts, such as performance issues or system outages.

### 2. **Ticket Categorization and Assignment**
Once a ticket is created, Symphony Summit follows a systematic process to categorize and assign the ticket to the appropriate teams:

- **Categorization**:
  - The system uses predefined categories for tickets, such as hardware issues, software problems, network issues, or service requests.
  - Categorization can be automatic based on keywords or details from the ticket or done manually by helpdesk agents.

- **Ticket Classification**:
  - Tickets are classified as incidents (unplanned disruptions), service requests (routine services like password resets), or changes (modifications to IT services).

- **Auto-Assignment**:
  - Based on the categorization and priority of the ticket, Symphony Summit uses predefined rules (workflows) to assign the ticket to the correct team or support group.
  - If the assignment rules are unclear, the ticket may first be routed to a central service desk team.

- **Prioritization**:
  - Each ticket is prioritized based on the **impact** (how many users or systems are affected) and **urgency** (how quickly the issue needs to be resolved).
  - The priority can range from low to critical, affecting how the ticket is handled within SLAs.

### 3. **Ticket Processing and Resolution**
Once a ticket is assigned to the correct team:

- **Investigation and Diagnosis**:
  - The assigned team investigates the issue by reviewing the details provided in the ticket, consulting knowledge bases, or contacting the user for additional information.
  - For service requests, the processing might involve approving the request and then fulfilling it (e.g., providing access to a system or resetting a password).

- **Collaboration and Escalation**:
  - If the issue is complex or beyond the team’s expertise, the ticket can be escalated to higher-level support (L2, L3) or specialized teams.
  - Agents can collaborate using internal comments or attach relevant documentation to the ticket.
  - Symphony Summit supports **SLA-based escalations** where tickets automatically escalate if resolution times are close to breach.

- **Solution Proposal**:
  - Once a potential fix or solution is identified, the team applies it (e.g., resetting systems, resolving bugs, or reconfiguring networks).
  - The solution is tested, and if successful, the team updates the ticket with the resolution steps.

### 4. **Ticket Resolution and Closure**
After the ticket is resolved:

- **User Confirmation**:
  - The resolved ticket is communicated back to the end user via email or the portal.
  - In some cases, users are asked to confirm whether the issue has been satisfactorily resolved. The user can accept or reject the resolution.
  - If the user confirms that the issue is resolved, the ticket is marked as **closed**.

- **Automatic Closure**:
  - If no feedback is received from the user within a predefined period (e.g., 48 hours), Symphony Summit can automatically close the ticket after assuming the issue is resolved.

- **Knowledge Base Update**:
  - If the incident or service request is recurring or of high importance, the resolution steps may be added to the knowledge base to help in faster future resolutions.

---

### 5. **Service-Level Agreement (SLA) Management**
Throughout the lifecycle of a ticket, Symphony Summit tracks the ticket against **SLAs**:

- **SLA Timers**: SLA timers are activated once the ticket is created, and Symphony Summit tracks the time until the issue is resolved.
- **SLA Breach Warnings**: The system sends notifications or escalates the ticket automatically if the SLA is in danger of being breached (e.g., if the ticket is nearing its resolution deadline).

---

### 6. **Reporting and Analytics**
Symphony Summit provides real-time dashboards and detailed reports to track key metrics such as:

- **Ticket Volume**: How many tickets were created, resolved, or closed in a given time period.
- **Resolution Times**: Average time taken to resolve tickets by priority or category.
- **SLA Adherence**: Percentage of tickets resolved within SLA vs. breached tickets.
- **Agent Performance**: Tracking how well individual agents or teams are performing based on their ticket load and resolution efficiency.

---

### 7. **Post-Incident Review and Continuous Improvement**
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: For major incidents or recurring issues, a post-incident review may be initiated to identify the root cause and propose preventive actions.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Insights from ticket data can help IT teams improve processes, reduce incident occurrence, and enhance user satisfaction.
